•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for their clients.  They are looking to modernize their software while keeping security at the forefrontof considerations.
    
•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
    I found that I was able to review the code and find security vulnerabilities well.  It is important that the code is secure as you are holding onto your client’s personal      information.  Allowing a hacker entry into the code puts the customer in danger of theft.  When a client feels that their information is safe, they will be more likely to    invest more and to stay with that company longer.
    
•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Performing the Maven dependency check was difficult.  I struggled to get the code to work.   When I did, it was very helpful to be able to see the listed vulnerabilities and work through them.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    One of the biggest ways to increase the security is when it comes to input.  Requiring a strong password to be used and updated frequently is helpful.  Putting in length and character constraints is also helpful.  I would definitely use both static testing and manual review.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    With doing both the dependency check and the manual review, as code was changed, you want to run the program and verify it is still working properly.  Often, more than one test will need to be ran.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    I like using the dependency check.  Learning how to suppress the false positives is important so that as a developer, you can see what issues need to be addressed.
    
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    One of the most important things to me is learning to successfully develop a comprehensive mitigation plan.  You want to be able to identify areas of concern and write it out so that you can share with your team and potentially shareholders or the customer what items you have addressed and will address in the future,
